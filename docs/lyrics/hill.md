想说却还没说的 还很多  
There's still so much I want to say but haven't said  
攒着是因为想写成歌  
I've been saving it all to turn into a song  
让人轻轻地唱著 淡淡地记著  
For people to sing softly, to remember faintly  
就算终于忘了 也值了  
Even if they finally forget, it will have been worth it  

说不定我一生涓滴意念  
Perhaps the droplets of thoughts throughout my life  
侥幸汇成河 然后我俩各自一端  
Will luckily converge into a river, then we'll each stand at opposite banks  
望著大河弯弯 终于敢放胆  
Watching the great river wind and bend, finally daring to be bold  
嘻皮笑脸 面对 人生的难  
Grinning and laughing in the face of life's hardships  

也许我们从未成熟  
Maybe we never truly matured  
还没能晓得 就快要老了  
Before we could understand, we're already growing old  
尽管心里活著的还是那个 年轻人  
Though the one still alive in our hearts is that young person  

因为不安而频频回首  
Because of anxiety, we keep looking back  
无知地索求 羞耻于求救  
Ignorantly demanding, too ashamed to ask for help  
不知疲倦地翻越 每一个山丘  
Tirelessly climbing over every single hill  

越过山丘 虽然已白了头  
Over the hill, though my hair has turned white  
喋喋不休 时不我予的哀愁  
Rambling on and on about time's unwillingness to wait  
还未如愿见著不朽  
Before achieving the immortality I hoped for  
就把自己先搞丢  
I've already lost myself  

越过山丘 才发现无人等候  
Over the hill, only to find no one waiting  
喋喋不休 再也唤不回温柔  
Rambling on and on, unable to summon tenderness again  
为何记不得上一次是谁给的拥抱  
Why can't I remember who gave me that last embrace  
在什么时候  
Or when it was  

我没有刻意隐藏 也无意让你感伤  
I haven't deliberately hidden anything, nor meant to make you sad  
多少次我们无醉不欢  
So many times we wouldn't stop until we were drunk  
咒骂人生太短 唏嘘相见恨晚  
Cursing life for being too short, sighing that we met too late  
让女人把妆哭花了 也不管  
Making women cry their makeup off, and not even caring  

遗憾我们从未成熟  
Regrettably, we never truly matured  
还没能晓得 就已经老了  
Before we could understand, we've already grown old  
尽力却仍不明白  
Trying our best but still not understanding  
身边的年轻人  
The young people around us  

给自己随便找个理由  
Finding random excuses for ourselves  
向情爱的挑逗 命运的左右  
Against love's temptations, fate's manipulations  
不自量力地还手 直至死方休  
Fighting back beyond our means until death do us part  

越过山丘 虽然已白了头  
Over the hill, though my hair has turned white  
喋喋不休 时不我予的哀愁  
Rambling on and on about time's unwillingness to wait  
还未如愿见著不朽  
Before achieving the immortality I hoped for  
就把自己先搞丢  
I've already lost myself

Why can't I remember who gave me that last embrace

# A puma at large[^1]

Pumas are large, cat-like[^2] animals which are found[^3] in America. When reports came into[^4] London Zoo that[^5] a wild puma had been spotted[^6] forty-five miles south[^7] of London, they were not taken seriously.[^8] However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given[^9] by people who claimed[^10] to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.[^11]

    > 英语中的从句基本可以分为三大类：
    >
    > - 形容词性从句：定语从句
    > - 副词性从句：状语从句
    > - 名词性从句：主语从句/宾语从句/表语从句/同位语从句

    !!! note "同位语从句和定语从句的区别"

        1.  从定义上看：同位语从句解释前面名词的具体内容；而定语从句仅起到后置定语的作用，常译为“⋯⋯的”。
        2.  从形式上看：同位语从句中的“that”仅起到连接符号的作用，不充当语法成分；而定语从句中的“that”一般是关系代词，在从句中充当主语、宾语或表语。

    !!! example

        造句: 随着病例（case）开始慢慢增多, 医学专家们（specialist）觉得必须要调查了,因为得了这种病的人的症状（symptom）特别地相似。

        As the cases began to accumulate, specialists felt obliged to investigate, for the symptoms of people who had caught the disease were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt[^12] for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw ‘a large cat’ only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved[^13] difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever[^14] it went, it left behind it a trail of[^15] dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen[^16] in a number of places and puma fur[^17] was found clinging[^18] to bushes. Several people complained[^19] of ‘cat-like noises’ at night and a businessman on[^20] a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced[^21] that the animal *was* a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must[^22] have been in the possession[^23] of a private collector and somehow managed[^24] to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It[^25] is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

## 课文翻译

美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一头野生美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。

搜寻美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的。那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时看见“一只大猫”离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮除非被逼得走投无路，否则是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它走到哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿以及死兔子之类的小动物。在许多地方看见了爪印，灌木丛中也发现了粘在上面的美洲狮毛。有人抱怨说夜里听见了“像猫一样的叫声”；一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢？由于全国的动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏家豢养的，不知怎么设法逃出来了。搜寻工作进行了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人担心。

# A puma at large[^1]

Pumas are large, cat-like[^2] animals which are found in America.[^3] When reports came into[^4] London Zoo that[^5] a wild puma had been spotted[^6] forty-five miles south of[^7] London, they were not taken seriously.[^8] However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given[^9] by people who claimed[^10] to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.[^11]

    英语中的从句基本可以分为三大类：

    - 形容词性从句：定语从句
    - 副词性从句：状语从句
    - 名词性从句：
        + 主语从句
        + 宾语从句
        + 表语从句
        + 同位语从句

    同位语从句和定语从句的区别：

    1.  从定义上看：同位语从句解释前面名词的具体内容；而定语从句仅起到后置定语的作用，常译为“⋯⋯的”。
    2.  从形式上看：同位语从句中的“that”仅起到连接符号的作用，不充当语法成分；而定语从句中的“that”一般是关系代词，在从句中充当主语、宾语或表语。

    - The proposal **that John put forward** is unacceptable.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw ‘a large cat’ only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of ‘cat-like noises’ at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal *was* a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

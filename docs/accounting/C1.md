# 财务报表与商业决策

Le-Nature’s Inc. designed its business strategy to ride the growing wave of interest 
in noncarbonated beverages. And apparently its strategy was a huge success. Its 
financial statements reported growth in sales from $156 to $275 million in just 
three years. How did this small family-run business compete with ==the likes of== Coke and 
Pepsi in this growing market? The business press suggested the first key to its success 
was manufacturing a broad range of products that fit into the fastest growing “healthy” 
segments: flavored waters, teas, and fruit drinks. Founder and CEO Gregory Podlucky 
said that an obsessive drive for quality and efficiency was just as critical. Matching 
customers’ concerns for the environment and healthy living, Le-Nature’s was praised as 
one of the first companies to switch to environmentally friendlier PET plastic bottles and to 
employ safe in-bottle ==pasteurization==. Its 21st-century manufacturing operation in Latrobe, 
Pennsylvania, produced everything that goes into its products, from the injection-molded 
PET bottles to the final packaging. Complete control over the whole process assures 
quality and provides the flexibility to respond quickly to changes in customers’ demands. 
When convenience stores moved to larger-sized drinks or school cafeterias switched 
from carbonated beverages to healthier drinks, Le-Nature’s could change its production 
to meet the customers’ needs. The company even opened a second new state-of-the-art 
manufacturing facility in Arizona to meet the apparent growing demand.
